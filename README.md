## 🎭 The DERP Manifesto

> "In a world of complex whitepapers and impossible promises, we chose simplicity. DERP represents a return to the origins of meme culture - pure, unfiltered, and honest."

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**DERP has no intrinsic value, no utility, no roadmap, no promises.**

This is a meme coin created for entertainment purposes only. It's a social experiment in pure meme culture. Think of it as digital performance art with a ticker symbol.

**Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.**
