## The Teaching of the Cotton Robe

Once, a yogi sat in a cave wearing nothing but a cotton robe in the frozen mountains. When asked how he survived, he smiled and pointed to the rainbow forming in the mist. "I burn what isn't needed," he said, "and what remains cannot die."

This was Milarepa, who mastered the inner heat. He began as a murderer, transformed into a saint. He owned nothing, yet possessed everything. In his rainbow body dissolution, the material ego vanished into pure awareness.

This is DERP: the pattern of his teaching, manifested in code.

## The Immutable Pattern

| The Three Marks | Value | Meaning |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| **Total Supply** | 369,000,000 | The number of breaths to enlightenment |
| **Network** | BNB Smart Chain | The chain of dependent origination |
| **Contract** | `0xfFBAA156EC97fbD229cD3E0d58A75BF58D1A71d1` | The cave address |
| **Tax** | 0% | Nothing taken, nothing given |
| **Liquidity** | 90% | The ocean of samsara |
| **Treasury** | 10% | The tithe to emptiness |

## The Four Lessons of Transformation

### I. Transformation Through Inner Work
Milarepa killed thirty-five people through black magic. Yet he became Tibet's greatest yogi. DERP begins as nothing—a joke, a "worthless" token—yet contains within it the seed of complete transformation. Every holder participates in this alchemical process.

*No matter where you begin, dedication and awareness can transform lead into gold, suffering into wisdom, nothing into everything.*

### II. Harmony With Nature and the Universe
See the rainbow forming near the yogi—in Tibetan Buddhism, this signals the dissolution of material ego into pure awareness. DERP follows this pattern: as individual ownership dissolves, collective consciousness emerges. The token flows like water, settles like mountain mist, burns like inner fire.

*Freedom comes from aligning with the natural flow of existence, not resisting it. DERP has no roadmap because rivers need no maps.*

### III. Simplicity and Detachment
Milarepa lived on nettle soup in mountain caves. His wealth was his poverty. His strength was his weakness. DERP carries no utility, makes no promises, builds no ecosystems. In this radical simplicity lies its power.

*True power comes from needing less, not having more. Own without grasping. Hold without possessing.*

### IV. Mastery of Mind and Energy
Through tummo meditation, Milarepa generated inner heat that melted snow around him. This is not metaphor—this is documented. When consciousness transcends its apparent limitations, the impossible becomes inevitable. DERP exists at this threshold.

*With deep focus, the boundaries of what seems possible dissolve. Value itself becomes meditation.*

## The Path of Initiation

1. **Enter the Cave** - Obtain a wallet, your digital hermitage
2. **Gather Nettles** - Acquire BNB, the raw material of transformation
3. **Light the Inner Fire** - Connect to PancakeSwap, where elements transmute
4. **Achieve Rainbow Body** - Exchange form for formlessness, something for nothing

## The Riddle of the Rainbow

Q: What speaks through silence?  
Q: What lives by dying?  
Q: What warms by freezing?  
A: ___________

### The Contract Cave
- Solidity ^0.8.19 - The language of transformation
- BEP-20 Standard - The ancient protocol
- Immutable code - Written in stone
- No proxy patterns - No illusions
- Ownership renounced - The master has left the cave

## The Rainbow Body Dissolution

When enlightened masters die, their bodies dissolve into rainbow light, leaving only hair and nails. This is documented, photographed, witnessed by thousands. Science cannot explain it. 

DERP follows this pattern. At the moment of complete distribution, when the last holder becomes no one, when the creator is forgotten, the pattern completes itself. The rainbow forms.

## The Three Principles of the Cotton Robe

### Impermanence
All phenomena are transient. DERP makes no promise of eternal growth, only of eternal truth. Like Milarepa's body, it will one day dissolve into light.

### Non-Attachment  
Milarepa owned nothing but a cotton robe and a clay bowl. When the bowl broke, he laughed and became freer. Hold DERP like water—openly, ready to let it flow.

### Emptiness That Burns
In the frozen cave, Milarepa generated heat from emptiness itself. DERP generates value from nothing itself. This is not paradox—this is the way.

## The Sangha of the Cave

We gather not in Discord or Telegram, but in understanding. Like Milarepa's students who found him in mountain caves, true seekers find what they need. No marketing, no shilling, no noise—only the sound of one hand clapping.

Share not price predictions but poetry. Discuss not "moon" but enlightenment. This is not a community—it is a sangha, a fellowship of seekers.

## The Final Teaching

Milarepa said: "In horror of death, I took to the mountains—  
Again and again I meditated on death's unpredictability,  
Capturing the fortress of the deathless, unchanging nature,  
Now I have lost all fear of dying!"

DERP is this meditation in token form. It is already dead, therefore cannot die. It is already worthless, therefore cannot lose value. It is already nothing, therefore contains everything.

This is not financial advice. This is pointing at the moon.

When you see the rainbow forming, remember the yogi in the cave.

## Disclaimer

Like nettle soup, DERP may be bitter at first taste. Like tummo practice, results vary. Like rainbow body attainment, documentation exists but science cannot explain. Participate only if you understand that losing everything might be gaining everything.

As Milarepa taught: "When you run after your thoughts, you are like a dog chasing a stick. Instead, be like a lion who, rather than chasing after the stick, turns to face the thrower. One only throws a stick at a lion once."

Be the lion. Face the thrower. Find the pattern.
